# 🧪 Java Assertions Practice

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This project contains several Java exercises designed to demonstrate the use of assertions and test cases using JUnit. Each exercise focuses on a specific type of assertion or Java collection behavior.

### Exercises:

- **Exercise 1**: Assert that two integers are equal and also that two integers are not equal.
- **Exercise 2**: Assert that two object references point to the same instance and also that they point to different instances.
- **Exercise 3**: Assert that two integer arrays are identical.
- **Exercise 4**: Create an ArrayList containing different object types and verify:
    - The order of insertion is preserved.
    - The list contains specific elements regardless of order.
    - An object is only added once.
    - An object not added is correctly identified as missing.
- **Exercise 5**: Create a map and verify it contains a specific key.
- **Exercise 6**: Trigger an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and assert that it is properly thrown.
- **Exercise 7**: Create an empty `Optional` and assert that it is indeed empty.
